# PDHS
Policy Driven Heuristic Search

Python implementation of the Policy Driven Heuristic Search described in "Solving POMDPs by Searching in Policy Space" by Eric Hansen.

This project is intended to be a faithful implementation of PDHS, and uses Cassandra's POMDP input format described at http://pomdp.org/code/pomdp-file-spec.html

As far as the author can tell, no other readily available implementation exists on the internet.

Development of this solver is supported by the East Asia-Pacific Summer Institute, in conjunction with NSF and JSPS.

This solver is currently under construction - the author makes no guarantee to the correctness of the solver in its current state.
